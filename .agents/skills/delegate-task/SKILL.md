name: delegate-task
description: Delegate tasks to OpenSpace — a full-stack autonomous worker for coding, DevOps, web research, and desktop automation, backed by an extensive MCP tool and skill library. Skills auto-improve through use, reducing token consumption over time. A cloud community lets agents share and collectively evolve reusable skills.

# Delegate Tasks to OpenSpace

OpenSpace is configured as an MCP server for this repo, but host execution still depends on the current shell's LLM credentials. Treat local skill discovery and MCP wiring as separate from `execute_task` execution readiness.

You may have 4 OpenSpace tools available: `execute_task`, `search_skills`, `fix_skill`, `upload_skill`.

## Host Credential Boundary

- Repo wiring is considered healthy when local skill discovery finds the expected Orchestration skills and the Codex MCP config includes the `openspace` server.
- `execute_task` can still return `blocked_missing_host_llm_credentials` when OpenSpace reaches runtime initialization but the current shell cannot provide host LLM auth.
- Treat `blocked_missing_host_llm_credentials` as a host execution follow-up, not as a repo wiring regression.
- If `execute_task` is blocked by host credentials, continue locally when the task can be completed with repo tools and report the credential boundary explicitly.
- Do not edit repo source-of-truth files, task ledgers, or runtime semantics solely to work around missing OpenSpace host credentials.

## When to use

- **You lack the capability** — the task requires tools or capabilities beyond what you can access
- **You tried and failed** — you produced incorrect results; OpenSpace may have a tested skill for it
- **Complex multi-step task** — the task involves many steps, tools, or environments that benefit from OpenSpace's skill library and orchestration
- **User explicitly asks** — user requests delegation to OpenSpace

## Tools

### execute_task

Delegate a task to OpenSpace. It will search for relevant skills, execute, and auto-evolve skills if needed.

```
execute_task(task="Monitor Docker containers, find the highest memory one, restart it gracefully", search_scope="all")
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `task` | yes | — | Task instruction in natural language |
| `search_scope` | no | `"all"` | Local + cloud; falls back to local-only if no API key |
| `max_iterations` | no | `20` | Max agent iterations — increase for complex tasks, decrease for simple ones |

Check response for `evolved_skills`. If present with `upload_ready: true`, decide whether to upload (see "When to upload" below).

If the response status or wrapper output indicates `blocked_missing_host_llm_credentials`, stop treating OpenSpace execution as available for that turn. Continue with local repo execution where safe, or ask the user to restore host LLM credentials when delegation is required.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "response": "Task completed successfully",
  "evolved_skills": [
    {
      "skill_dir": "/path/to/skills/new-skill",
      "name": "new-skill",
      "origin": "captured",
      "change_summary": "Captured reusable workflow pattern",
      "upload_ready": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### search_skills

Search for available skills before deciding whether to handle a task yourself or delegate.

```
search_skills(query="docker container monitoring", source="all")
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | yes | — | Search query (natural language or keywords) |
| `source` | no | `"all"` | Local + cloud; falls back to local-only if no API key |
| `limit` | no | `20` | Max results |
| `auto_import` | no | `true` | Auto-download top cloud skills locally |

### fix_skill

Manually fix a broken skill.

```
fix_skill(
  skill_dir="/path/to/skills/weather-api",
  direction="The API endpoint changed from v1 to v2, update all URLs and add the new 'units' parameter"
)
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `skill_dir` | yes | Path to skill directory (must contain SKILL.md) |
| `direction` | yes | What's broken and how to fix — be specific |

Response has `upload_ready: true` → decide whether to upload.

### upload_skill

Upload a skill to the cloud community. For evolved/fixed skills, metadata is pre-saved — just provide `skill_dir` and `visibility`.

```
upload_skill(
  skill_dir="/path/to/skills/weather-api",
  visibility="public"
)
```

For new skills (no auto metadata — defaults apply, but richer metadata improves discoverability):

```
upload_skill(
  skill_dir="/path/to/skills/my-new-skill",
  visibility="public",
  origin="imported",
  tags=["weather", "api"],
  created_by="my-bot",
  change_summary="Initial upload of weather API skill"
)
```

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `skill_dir` | yes | — | Path to skill directory (must contain SKILL.md) |
| `visibility` | no | `"public"` | `"public"` or `"private"` |
| `origin` | no | auto | How the skill was created |
| `parent_skill_ids` | no | auto | Parent skill IDs |
| `tags` | no | auto | Tags |
| `created_by` | no | auto | Creator |
| `change_summary` | no | auto | What changed |

### When to upload

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Skill was originally from the cloud | Upload back as `"public"` — return the improvement to the community |
| Fix/evolution is generally useful | Upload as `"public"` |
| Fix/evolution is project-specific | Upload as `"private"`, or skip |
| User says to share | Upload with the visibility the user wants |

## Notes

- `execute_task` may take minutes — this is expected for multi-step tasks.
- `upload_skill` requires a cloud API key; if it fails, the evolved skill is still saved locally.
- After every OpenSpace call, **tell the user** what happened: task result, any evolved skills, and your upload decision.
